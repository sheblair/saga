## SAGA

Hi! This is a custom WordPress theme based on [`_s`](https://underscores.me/). I built this theme for [the Society of American Graphic Artists](https://www.sagaprints.com/), a non-profit organization for artists living in the United States and working in the graphic arts. I worked closely with two members of the organization's leadership to design the desktop layout, and then used that as the basis for mobile- and tablet-optimized designs which I created on my own.
